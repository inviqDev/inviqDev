ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @inviqDev [Konstantin Leschev]

I'm a beginner programmer who is focused on C# and Unity development. 
I started learning on my own, gained solid knowledge, and keep growing. 
Right now, I'm studying C# in a professional course. 
My goal is to become a confident developer and build a career in game development.
